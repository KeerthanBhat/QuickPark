Smart Parking System web application

This project is heavily under development. 
It was done as a part of an IoT hackathon by the group TheAbsoluteZeroes Inc.

The web app currently shows only static results. It has to integrated to any cloud to get real time parking availability data and the same has to be displayed to the user.
